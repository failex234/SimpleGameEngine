This is just a training for me to try something new
and learn something along the way.

My biggest goal is to make a raycasting renderer in the future
but that's still far away for me.

Currently I'm just playing around and figuring out how to
draw different shapes and calculate all necessary vertices
for the shape.

The base of this project is highly influenced by liz3's
Space Shooter that I used to lear some of the basics of SFML.
